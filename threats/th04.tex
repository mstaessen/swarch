\subsubsection{T04 -- Information disclosure of user data}

\paragraph{Summary}

\npar An authenticated user can access personal information of other users.

\paragraph{Primary mis-actor}

\npar unskilled insider / skilled outsider

\paragraph{Basic path}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[bf1.] The misactor authenticates himserlf (by using his own valid
	credentials or by spoofing a user (e.g. The retrieval of his credentials, see
	threat \ref{threats:t05})).
    \item[bf2.] The misactor gains access to the user data.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consequence}

\npar Confidential user, measurement and/or alarm configuration data is exposed
to unauthorized users or outsiders.

\paragraph{Reference to threat tree node(s)}

ID\_ds7, ID\_ds2

\paragraph{Parent threat tree(s)}

ID\_ds

\paragraph{DFD element(s)}

1.8 Measurement and information data store, 1.9 user data store and 1.10 alarm
configuration data store

\paragraph{Remarks}
	\begin{enumerate}
         \item[r1.] This threat is applicable to all data stores.
         \item[r2.] Side channel attacks are not considered (see assumption
         %TODO ref)
         \item[r3.] Because of the weak access control system (assumption nr.
         %TODO ref)
		 ID\_ds7 is applicable, since there is no protection for authenticated users.
         \item[r4.] Due to assumption number %TODO ref)
		 ID\_ds3 till ID\_ds5 are eliminated.
         \item[] %TODO spoofing is a precondition?
    \end{enumerate}
