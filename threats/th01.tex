\subsubsection{T01- Linking measurementsdata}
\label{threats:t01}

\paragraph{Summary}

\npar A researcher or other insider wich malicious intents links measurement,
user or alarm configuration data.

\paragraph{Primary mis-actor}

\npar unskilled insider (authenticated user, e.g. researcher)

\paragraph{Basic path}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[bf1.] The misactor performs a set of targeted queries on the
	measurements data and retrieves very detailed results.
    \item[bf2.] The misactor links the results of the queries together (e.g.
    based on the regio where the measurements are from)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consequence}

\npar By applying these data mining algorithms on the query results the misactor
has more knowledge of information about ReMeS or users than desirable. 

\paragraph{Reference to threat tree node(s)} 

L\_ds1, L\_ds2


\paragraph{Parent threat tree(s)}

L\_ds

\paragraph{DFD element(s)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Measurement and information data
  \item User data
  \item Alarm configuration data
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Remarks}

	\begin{enumerate}
         \item[r1.] Altough this threat mainly describes the measurements
         and information data, it also applies to all data stores, namely
         Measurement and information, user and alarm configuration data.
         \item[r2.] Because of assumption %TODO ref
		 , the misactor has access to several (strong) data mining technique and hence
		 L\_ds2 is fulfilled
         \item[r3.] Node L\_ds1 is applicable due to assumption %TODO ref.
    \end{enumerate}
