\subsubsection{TXX -- Missing consumer consents} % TODO
\paragraph{Summary} The system did not ask the consumer's permission to share
part of his (pseudonymized) measurements information with researchers, other
consumers and utility companies.

\paragraph{Primary mis-actor} Management

\paragraph{Basic path}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[bf1.] The management fails to require consumer's consents to be included
	in the data flow.
	\item[bf2.] The consumer is unable to state his preferences concerning sharing
	measurements data.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consequence} The consumer's measurements data will be shared with
others against his will.

\paragraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
     \item[r1.] This threat applies to the entire system (see assumption 1).
     \item[r2.] A general threat which corresponds to general non-compliance is
     described in ?? % TODO referentie
