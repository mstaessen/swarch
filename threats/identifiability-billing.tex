\subsubsection{TXX -- Identifiability of bills sent to the Third Party Billing
Web Service}
% TODO
\paragraph{Summary} The misactor extracts the consumer's identity from the sent
bills and links it to other bills.

\paragraph{Primary mis-actor} unskilled insider (Third Party Billing Web
Service)

\paragraph{Basic path}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[bf1.] New bills are sent to the third party billing web service
	\item[bf2.] The misactor intercepts the data flow
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Consequence} The misactor can build a financial and consumption
profile of the consumer. 

\paragraph{Reference to threat tree node(s)} I_df3, I_df10

\paragraph{Parent threat tree(s)} I_df

\paragraph{DFD element(s)} data flow from 1.7 Billing to 5. Third Party Billing
Web Service

\paragraph{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[r1.] The misactor is the receiver, which justifies this threat.
	\item[r2.] The data flow is encrypted (see assumption ??), which will prevent
	information disclosure to outsiders.
	% TODO: assumptie encryptie
	\item[r3.] The consumer is identifiable, based on the identifier on the bill
	(I_df10).
	\item[r4.] The right branch of the three (I_df4 and children) is not considered
	because it is not the sender whose identity should be protected, but the
	consumer, who is not directly a part of the data flow.
\end{enumerate}
