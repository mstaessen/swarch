\chapter{Introduction}

\npar In this project a remote measurement, monitoring and control system
(ReMeS) for utilties such as gas, water and electricity is developed. The
project started with the formulation of the nonfunctional and functional
requirements of this system. In this phase the goal is to design an architecture
which support those requirements. 

\npar This design phase is guided by the attribute driven design method, known
as ADD. Each iteration of this design method is documented in chapter
\ref{chap:add}. The final result can be found in the next chapter,
\ref{chap:final-architecture}. The accompanying interface- and element catalog
can be found in the appendix. In a last chapter the a number of example
scenario's can be found, which are presented as (UML) sequence diagrams.
