\section{Iteration 1: Decomposition of the whole system}
\label{add:it1}

\npar In the first iteration, the whole system, ReMeS is decomposed. It takes
all the requirements and quality attribute scenarios as input.

\npar Two subsystems are recognized: a ``Remote Module Subsystem'' and the
``Portal''. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:add/it1/decomposition}.

\subsection{Step 1: Identify candidate drivers}
\label{add:it1/drivers}

% TODO verwijs naar step 0?

\npar For the first decomposition, two high priority quality attribute scenarios
and their associated use cases are taken into account. 

\begin{itemize}
 	\item Av1 (High): Measurement database Failure
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item UC8 (High): Send measurement
 		\item UC13 (High): Send alarm 
 	\end{itemize}
  	\item P1 (High): Timely closure of valves
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item UC13 (High): Send alarm 
  	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\npar The considered use cases includes the use cases listed below. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item UC7 (High): Send trame to remote device
	\item UC9 (High): Notify customer
	\item UC10 (Medium): Detect anomaly
\end{itemize}

\npar Based on the architectural drivers, the remote module subsystem has to
provide functionality for remote module communication (receiving and sending
trames), trame storage, trame processing and customer communication. 

\npar In order to obtain a better understanding of the relationships between
these functionalities, a small domain model is drafted. Figure
\ref{fig:add/it1/draft} This model can then be refined later on
in this level of decomposition.

\subsection{Step 2: Choose design concepts}
\label{add:it1/concepts}

\subsubsection{Tactics}
\label{add:it1/tactics}

\paragraph{Availability}

\npar After selecting the drivers for the current decomposition, one has to
choose the tactics to achieve them. Recall from section
\ref{drivers:whole-system} that the first driver was Av1. All approaches to
maintain availability involve either detection, recovery or prevention of
faults.

\npar First of all, a fault needs to be detected. For this, there are three
options: ping/echo, heartbeat and exceptions. It is important to notice that the
latter is not very practical. This can be illustrated with a simple example.

\npar Suppose that a component $c_1$ depends on another component $c_2$. For
some reason, $c_1$ does not need the services of $c_2$ for a duration longer
than the detection interval of 5 seconds (see Av1). Within this time, no
detection can occur, simply because there is no interaction between the
components. For this reason, we eliminate exceptions as a primary fault
detection system. However, exceptions will still have to be implemented in order
to make the system fail gracefully (a component being unavailable will not
cause the system to crash).

\npar Another detection method uses ping/echo. This primarily focusses on
network connectivity and will not check the availabillity of the service itself.
Again, this is not very practical. A server can be reachable, but the service on
a certain port number may be unavailable. In this case, the ping/echo
method would not detect the fault. 

\npar Heartbeat on the other hand, will be part of the system itself and will be
able to check whether the service is still up and running. It will periodically
(at most every 5 seconds) check the state of the system and send out a pulse
to a heartbeat monitor if everything is runnning fine.

\npar Another advantage of using heartbeat is that the pulse can contain data,
more specifically status data. For instance, a single failing disk in a RAID5
array can cause a warning but will not cause the system to crash. This
information can be included in the pulse of the heartbeat to inform the
administrators to replace the failing disk.

\npar As a result, heartbeat seems the best solution to detect faults. 

\npar Detecting a fault is insufficient, resolving the fault is at least equally
important. Once a fault has been detected, the faulting component must be taken
out of action and be repaired or replaced with a working version. However, in
order to guarantee an uptime of 99.9\%, there has to be a backup to take over in
case of a component fault.

\npar As was the case in the previous paragraph, there are many alternatives.
The most frequently used ones are active redundancy, passive redundancy and
spare. The main criterion to select one of these is the downtime of the system.
These downtimes are respectively in the order of miliseconds, seconds and
minutes. An uptime of 99.9\% corresponds to 0.72 hours (= 43.2 minutes) of
permitted downtime on a monthly basis. This number reveals potential problems
when a spare is used because there can be only less the 10 failures a month. For
this reason, use of spares is eliminated.

\npar The difference between active and passive replication is rather subtle.
In an active replication scheme, the system will recover faster then in a
passive replication scheme. However, all replicas should be in a consistent
state. This increases the communication overhead, compared to a passive
replication scheme. 

\npar On the other hand, the active replication scheme can also provide load
balancing. If one replica has a higher load than another, the replica with the
lowest load can be used to process the query. For this reason, the active
replication scheme is selected. 

\paragraph{Performance} 

\npar For performance tactics there are three categories: resource
arbitration, resource management and resource demand.

\npar If there is more than one request to gain control over a resource, there
has to be some form of scheduling. By far the most used one is a priority
scheduler where request are served earlier when they have a higher priority.
This is particulary useful for alarms to still reach the appropriate parties in
time even when the system is in overload mode. 

\npar Secondly there is resource management. To process more than one trame at a
time, concurrency can be introduced. This can be done in various ways. Several
threads can be started on one processor, on separate processors or even on
separate systems. Another possibilitiy is off course increasing the available
hardware but since this is not a very cost effective solution, this is left out
of consideration.

\npar On a lower level one could also try to minimize network overhead by
only sending small amounts of data in each trame. This is achieved by
limiting the size of the trames to 160 bytes.

\npar To conclude a small overview is given of all selected tactics for this
decomposition.

\begin{itemize}
 	\item Av1 (High): Measurement database Failure
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Detection: Heartbeat 
 		\item Recovery : Active replication
 	\end{itemize}
  	\item P1 (High): Timely closure of valves
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Resource arbitration : Scheduling
		\item Resource management  : concurrency
		\item Resource demand      : limited tramesize
  	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design Patterns}
\label{add:it1/patterns} %TODO verder uitwerken

\npar With respect to resource arbitration and resouce management, the
\emph{Active Object} design pattern is chosen for trame communication and
processing. Schedulers will determine the order in which trames are received,
processed and sent. These schedulers will have different scheduling policies,
implemented with the \emph{Strategy} design pattern, in order to allow operation
in different modes.

\npar The trames will have to be objectified. This will yield two advantages.
Firstly, the scheduler can be implemented using the \emph{Command Processor}
design pattern. Secondly, a unified language will exist for all vendor
specific trame formats.

\npar To make the data highly available, the database will be replicated. This
can be achieved by using the \emph{Replicated Component Group} design pattern.
The database will be replaced with a front-end interface that replicates all
requests to all the replicas. 

\subsection{Step 3: Instantiate architectural elements and allocate responsibilities}
\label{add:it1/elements}

% TODO fig

\subsubsection{Communication unit}

\npar This module is responsible for all communication from and to remote
modules (all types of communication and both valves and control devices).
Incoming trames (from remote devices) are handed over to appropriate scheduler.
Trames which need to be sent to to remote modules are dispatched to the correct
module through the correct medium.

\subsubsection{Scheduler for incoming trames}

\npar This scheduler gets all incoming trames from remote modules and schedules
them for storage. Dependent to the active scheduling policy trames can be
prioritized over other trames. For instance, an incoming alarm trame for a gas
leak has top priority and has strict bounds on the delivery time (see the
quality attribute scenarios). Furthermore serves this scheduler as a buffer.
This is particularly useful when the storage unit is overloaded.

\subsubsection{Heartbeat monitor cluster}

\npar The heartbeat monitor cluster is the result of the tactic to detect a
fault, namely heartbeat. This component will monitor all other components to see
if they are still alive (i.e. not crashed). Off course it is not unthinkable
that the monitor component fails itself. Therefore this component has to monitor
itself by for example an extra monitor that monitors the monitor.

\subsubsection{Storage of trames}

\npar This component is the front end interface for database communication. This
means that it communicates with all the instances of the physical storage to
store a trame. Furthermore shall this unit notify the trame processing scheduler
that a new trame entered the system. 

\subsubsection{Scheduler for trame processing}

\npar When the storage unit has stored a new trame, this scheduler is notified
and fetches the freshly stored trame. Analogous to the other scheduler this
scheduler serves as a buffer to prevent overloading on the anomaly detection
unit. Once again different scheduling policies can be switched on.

\subsubsection{Call Center}

\npar This module is contacted by the anomaly detection. When the latter detects
a anomaly in the usage of one the utilities of a customer, then that customer
needs to notified. This is the responsibility of the call center.

\subsubsection{Anomaly Detection}

\npar The Anomaly Detection unit is responsible for running the algorithms to
discover anomalies. It is notified whenever new trames are stored in
the data storage (so it can process it). Upon detecting an anomaly two possible
actions (or both) can be undertaken. The first is sealing a valve if it is a
severe leak (This action is represented by the depenency between the
communication unit and the anomaly detection). The second is notifying the
approriate parties (the customer and/or the emergency services).

\subsection{Step 4: Define interfaces for instantiated elements}
\label{add:it1/interfaces}

% TODO text + fig


\subsection{Step 5: Verify and refine}
\label{add:it1/verification}

\npar In this step, we verify that that the element decomposition thus far meets
the functional requirements and quality attribute requirements. Also, child
elements are prepared for further decomposition.

\npar Three things have to be verified. First, we will verify that all
functional requirements and quality attribute requirements of the parent element
have been allocated to one or more child elements in the decomposition.
Secondly, all responsibilities that were assigned to child modules are
translated into functional requirements for the individual items and finally,
quality attribute scenarios for individual child elements are refined if
necessary.

\npar We will list all the child elements, together with their allocated use
cases and quality attribute requirements. If a requirement is split or
delegated, it is also mentioned in the list.
