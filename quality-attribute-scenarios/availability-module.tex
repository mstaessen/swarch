	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The system should detect and record the event.
	  \item As long as the corresponding module is not repaired, no data can
	  be received from or send to this module.
	  \item The module's host (i.e. the customer where the module is hosted) should
	  be notified.
	  \item A specialized technician should be dispatched to repair or replace the
	  module.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Response measure] \ 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The detection time should be at most the update frequency of the
	  corresponding module.
	  \item In 98\% of all cases the problem should be fixed within 2 days.
	  \item If these problems occur systematicly (rate > 2/year), usage
	  analysis and revision of SLA should be done within one month.
	\end{enumerate}
