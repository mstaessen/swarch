	\item[Source] External to the system
	\item[Stimulus] Fault: The transmission of data is unexpectedly
	(i.e. not by a scheduled maintenance) interrupted.
	\item[Artifact] Communication channels
	\item[Environment] During normal operation
	\item[Response] \
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The system should detect the network failure.
	  \item During the breakdown, no additional measurements can be collected nor
	  can alarms from modules be received. 
	  \item To prevent a (useless) overreaction, some basic troubleshooting is
	  passed through (checking the physical connections, rebooting the router,
	  etc.).
	  \item In case none of the above basic tips solved the problem, the network
	  provider should be notified about the crash.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Response measure] \
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Detection should be done under 1 minute.
	  \item In accordance to the SLA with the telecom operator, the data flow
	  should be re-established within the specified period.
	  \item If these problems occur systematicly (rate > 1/month), usage
	  analysis and revision of SLA should be done within one month.
	\end{enumerate}
