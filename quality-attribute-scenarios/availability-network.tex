	\item[Source] External to the system.
	\item[Stimulus] Fault: The transmission of data is unexpectedly
	(i.e. not by a scheduled maintenance) interrupted.
	This could be due to two reasons:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item One of the main transmission lines snaps during road maintenance.
	  \item The sms network is overloaded on Newyear's eve.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Artifact] Communication channels
	\item[Environment] During normal operation.
	\item[Response] \
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item The system should detect the network failure.
	  \item During the breakdown, no additional measurements can be collected nor
	  can alarms from modules be received. 
	  \item To prevent a (useless) overreaction, some basic troubleshooting is
	  passed through (checking the physical connections, rebooting the router,
	  etc.).
	  \item In case none of the above basic tips solved the problem, the network
	  provider should be notified of the crash.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[Response measure] \
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Detection should be done under x minutes %todo
	  \item In accordance to the SLA with the Telecom operator, The data flow
	  should be re-established within the specified period.
	  \item If this becoming unavailable gets systematic (rate > 1/month), usage
analysis and revision of SLA should be done within one month. %todo: gekopieerd
