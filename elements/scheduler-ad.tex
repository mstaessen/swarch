\section{Scheduler For Anomaly Detection}
\label{element:scheduler-ad}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This scheduler regulates all the traffic of ADCommands towards the
Anomaly Detection Unit. It accepts incoming ADCommands at a random rate (i.e.
the rate at which the communication and storage send them towards this
component) and it redirects them to the Anomaly Detection Unit. This
scheduler guarantees in addition that the rate at which it will send the
ADCommands to the detection unit will not exceed its maximum sending rate.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ADSchedulerAPI, see \ref{api:ad-scheduler-api}.
