\label{element:measurements-policy}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar A MeasurementsPolicy is responsible for inserting incoming
MeasurementsQueries (received from the MeasurementsScheduler) into the
MeasurementsQueue. To be able to do this, the policy first has to determine the
priority of the incoming query (and this priority is different for the various
policies).

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item MeasurementsPolicyAPI, see \ref{api:measurements-policy-api}.
