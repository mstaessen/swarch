\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The MeasurementsScheduler serves as entry point for the measurements
scheduling. Upon receiving a measurement, the scheduler will hand that
measurement over to a MeasurementsPolicy. When the system transitions between
load modi (from normal to overload or vice versa), it is possible that another
policy is used. This transition in policies is likewise the responsibility of
this component.
