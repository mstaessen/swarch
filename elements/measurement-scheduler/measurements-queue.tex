\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The measurements queue does nothing else than provide a priority queue for
measurementsqueries with accompanying insert and retrieve functionality. Since
it is a priority queue the queries can be placed in different places in the
queue depending on their priority. More precisely, for each priority level will
the index of the last element with that priority be kept in a list. When a new
query needs to be inserted, the priority of that query is determined.
Subsequently, the priority is used to retrieve the index of the last element and
in this way the new query can be inserted.
