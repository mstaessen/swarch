\section{Heartbeat Monitor}
\label{element:heartbeat-monitor}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This component acts as the registering point for heartbeats. The provided
functionality allows that each component can register itself so the monitor
knows it is still alive. When a component does not register itself appropriate
action is undertaken (i.e. a ReMeS operator is notified). Off course it is
always possible that the monitor itself fails. Therefore this component is in
fact a cluster of monitors where each monitor monitors every other monitor.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

  \item HealthMonitorAPI, see \ref{api:health-monitoring-unit-api}.
