\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The responsibility of this unit is limited to the generation of invoices.
Ths includes determining that an invoice should be constructed, fetching all the
relevant consumption data and constructing the invoice. The constructed invoice
is then sent towards the billing communication unit through the
\interface{BillingSendAPI} interface. One more task is assigned to this
component, namely the marking of paid invoices. To retrieve all data the
billing unit needs, first of all it has to have access through the internal
ReMeS customer database (through the \interface{CustomerProfileAPI} interface).
Secondly, it needs to be able to contact the UIS. This is done through the
\interface{CustomerInformation}.
