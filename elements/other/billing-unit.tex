\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The responsibility of this unit is limited to the generation of invoices.
This includes determining that an invoice should be constructed, fetching all
the relevant consumption data and constructing the invoice. The constructed
invoice is then sent towards the BillingCommunicationUnit through the
\interface{BillingSendAPI} interface. One more task is assigned to this
component, namely the marking of paid invoices. To retrieve all data the
BillingUnit needs to have access to the internal ReMeS customer database
(through the \interface{CustomerProfleAPI} interface) and needs to be able to
contact the UIS. This is done through the \interface{CustomerInformation}
interface.
