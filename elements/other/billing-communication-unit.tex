\npar The responsibility of this unit is the handling of all information between
ReMeS and external actors regarding billing. It has two major duties. The first
is to allow invoices to be sent towards the third party billing service after
the invoice has been constructed. The second task is to provide a possibility
for all notifications that need to be sent towards ReMeS concerning the payment
of invoices.

\npar The billing communication unit also uses functionality which is reflected
in the usage of the billing unit and third party billing service. The former one
is used to sent the notification of a payment towards the billing unit. It uses
