\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This component interacts with three other components. The first one,
Utility information system, is used for all information needed by ReMeS that is
stored by the utility company. The second one, prediction unit, is used to
acquire prediction statistics for a certain utility company. It offers two main
services towards other components: one towards the billing unit
and one towards the UIS. The former service includes the retrieval
of customer data that is kept by the UIS. The latter one is more of a
consultation service where the UIS can request predictions.
