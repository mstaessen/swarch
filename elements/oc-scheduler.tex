\section{Scheduler For Outbound Communication}
\label{element:scheduler-for-outbound-communication}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This scheduler has to regulate all the traffic of OCCommands towards the
Remote Module Communication Unit. It accepts incoming OCCommands at a random
rate (i.e. the rate at which the Anomaly Detection Unit sends them towards this
component) and it redirects them to the Remote Module Communication Unit. This
scheduler guarantees in addition that the rate at which it will send the
OCCommands to the communication unit will not exceed its maximum
sending rate.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

  \item OCSchedulerAPI, see \ref{api:oc-scheduler-api}.
