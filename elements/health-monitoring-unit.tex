\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The Health Monitoring Unit has a twofolded responsibiity. The first one is
notification of ReMeS operators in a case a problem occurs. One can contact this
component by sending a report which describes a certain problem. The second one
is to act as a registering point for heartbeats. The provided functionality
allows that each component can register itself so the monitor knows it is still
alive.
