\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The ADScheduler serves as entry point for the ADCommand scheduling. Upon
receiving a command the scheduler will place that command in an
ADPolicy. When the system transitions between load modi (from normal
to overload or vice versa) it is possible to change the current policy.
This transition in policies is likewise the responsibility of this component.
