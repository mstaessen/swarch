\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar An ADPolicy is responsible for inserting incoming ADCommands (received
from the ADScheduler) into the ADQueue. To be able to do this, the policy first
has to determine the priority of the incoming command (and this priority is
different for the various policies).

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ADPolicyAPI, see \ref{api:measurements-policy-api}.
