\section{MeasurementsStorageFrontEnd}
\label{element:measurements-storage-front-end}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The MeasurementsStorageFrontEnd acts as a business delegate and will
provide an interface to execute queries on the measurements database. The
FrontEnd will coordinate interaction between all (replicated) storage instances
and will also manage references to a TemporaryBuffer, for temporary storage of
measurement trames in case the database becomes unavailable. It also manages
access to a MeasurementsStorageCache to speed up requests to the measurements
database in case to load is high. Notice that the frontend also converts the
incoming QueryCommands to actual Queries.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}
