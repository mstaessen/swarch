\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The TemporaryBuffer component is introduced to provide at least 3 hours of
storage in case a database failure occurs. The MeasurementsStorageFrontEnd will redirect
all storage traffic (i.e. QueryCommands) towards this component. Notice that the
commands will be stored in this buffer, they won't be executed.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item TemporaryBufferAPI, see \ref{api:temporary-buffer-api}.
