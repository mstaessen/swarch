\section{RemoteModuleCommunication}
\label{element:rm-comm-unit}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This module is responsible for all communication from and to remote
modules (all types of communication and both valves and control devices).
Incoming trames (from remote devices) are handed over to the storage scheduler
(after conversion into QueryCommands). Trames which need to be sent to remote
modules are dispatched to the correct module through the correct medium.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item OutboundCommAPI, see \ref{api:rm-outbound-comm-api}.
  \item InboundCommAPI, see \ref{api:rm-inbound-comm-api}.
\end{itemize}
