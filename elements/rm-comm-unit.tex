\section{Remote Module Communication Unit}
\label{element:rm-comm-unit}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This module is responsible for all communication from and to remote
modules (all types of communication and both valves and control devices).
Incoming measurements (from remote devices) are handed over to the Scheduler For
MeasurementsStorage. Alarms are dispatched to the Scheduler For Anomaly
Detection. Trames which need to be sent to remote modules are dispatched to the
correct module through the correct medium.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item OutboundCommAPI, see \ref{api:rm-outbound-comm-api}.
  \item InboundCommAPI, see \ref{api:rm-inbound-comm-api}.
