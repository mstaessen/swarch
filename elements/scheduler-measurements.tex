\section{Scheduler For Measurements}
\label{element:scheduler-measurements}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This scheduler has to regulate all the traffic of QueryCommands towards
the MeasurementsStorage. It accepts incoming QueryCommands at a random rate (i.e.
the rate at which the other components send them towards this component) and
it redirects them to the MeasurementsStorage. In addition will it make sure
that the rate at which it will send the QueryCommands to the storage does not
overload the storage.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item MeasurementsSchedulerAPI, see \ref{api:measurements-scheduler-api}.
