\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The TrameConsumer is a forwarding unit which is subscribed to the
TrameEventChannel and receives all events which are published on it. It
converts all measurements into insert queries which are to be scheduled on the
measurement scheduler. Alarms are converted into ADCommands and they are
subsequentely sent to the Scheduler For Anomaly Detection. So this component is
at the same time a router and a translator.
