\section{Trame Consumer}
\label{element:rm-trame-consumer}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The trame consumer is a forwarding unit which is subscribed to the event
channel and receives all events which are published on it. It converts all
measurements into insert queries which are to be scheduled on the
measurement scheduler. Alarms are converted into ADCommands and they are
subsequentely sent to the anomaly scheduler. So this component is at the same
time a router and a translator.
