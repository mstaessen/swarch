\section{Deadline Monitor}
\label{element:rm-deadline-monitor}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The responsibility of this component is the monitoring of all passing
measurements and guaranteeing that a missing measurement is detected within the
demanded time limits. This monitor is subscribed to the event channel to receive
trames. To guarantee these limits the monitor keeps a table with expected
arrival times of all remote devices which is frenquently checked. The
information to build this table is fetched from the database which maintains
remote module information. Notice that to protect from failures, this table is
made persistent. When a deadline is exceeded, this is stored in the
corresponding database. When a certain number of deadline violations is reached,
a ReMeS operator is notified.
