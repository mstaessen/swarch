\section{Input Translator}
\label{element:rm-input-translator}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The input translator has as duty the translation of incoming (raw) trames
into objectified trames. Therefore it must know what the incoming data format
is. To realize this, it has a translator pool at its disposal where, based on
the module (type) a translator can be fetched. The translated trame is provided
with extra information concerning the customer (i.e. the owner of the module where the
trame came from). When the trames are translated they are published on the event
channel for all interested parties.
