	\section{Input Translator}
\label{element:rm-input-translator}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The input translator has as duty the translation of incoming (raw) trames
into objectified trames. Therefore it must know what the incoming data format
is. To realize this, it has a translator map at its disposal where, based on
the module (type) a translator can be fetched. When the trames are translated,
they are published on the event channel for all interested parties.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}
