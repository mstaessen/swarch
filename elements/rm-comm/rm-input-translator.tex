\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The InputTranslator has as duty the translation of incoming (raw) trames
into objectified trames. Therefore it must know what the incoming data format
is. To realize this, it has a TranslatorMap at its disposal where, based on
the module (type) a RemoteModuleTranslator can be fetched. When the trames are
translated, they are published on the event channel for all interested parties.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}
