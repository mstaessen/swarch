\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This component acts as the manager of the ADInstances. When a new
ADCommand enters the front end will fetch an instance of the instance pool which
will execute the command and return the result. Based on the result the front
end can determine whether it is a false alarm or a true alarm. In the latter
case the notification unit is contacted to send an alarm and possibly an
OCCommand is constructed and send to the OCScheduler to seal the
corresponding valve.
