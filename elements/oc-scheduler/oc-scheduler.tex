\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The OCScheduler serves as entry point for the OCCommand scheduling. Upon
receiving a command the scheduler will place that command in an
OCPolicy. When the system transitions between load modi (from normal
to overload or vice versa) it is possible to change the current policy.
This transition in policies is likewise the responsibility of this component.
