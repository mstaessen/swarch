\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar The OCQueue does nothing else than providing a priority queue for
OCCommands with accompanying insert and retrieve functionality. Since
it is a priority queue the commands can be inserted at different places in
the queue depending on their priority. 

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item OCQueueAPI, see \ref{api:oc-queue-api}.
