\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar An OCPolicy is responsible for inserting incoming OCCommands (received
from the OCScheduler) into the OCQueue. To be able to do this, the policy first
has to determine the priority of the incoming OCCommand (and this priority is
different for the various policies).

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item OCPolicyAPI, see \ref{api:oc-policy-api}.
