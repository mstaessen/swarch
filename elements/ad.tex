\section{Anomaly Detection Unit}
\label{element:anomaly-detection-unit}

\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This component is responsible for the actual detection of anomalies and
for determining the correctness of the found or sent alarms. Upon determining
that an alarm is real, the Notification Unit is contacted to send the alarm to
the customer. The machine learning algorithms typically work on datasets instead
of a single datum. Therefore extra alarm or measurement data can be fetched from
respectively the Shared Repository or the MeasureMentsStorage.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item AnomalyDetectionAPI, see \ref{api:anomaly-detection-api}.
