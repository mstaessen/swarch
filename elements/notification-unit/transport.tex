\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar A Transport component is responsible for communication towards the
stakeholders through a specific channel. Such a component does not has any
knowledge about the user. It simply accepts transport requests (of messages) and
executes them. Note that there will be different Transport components for SMS,
e-mail, etc.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}
