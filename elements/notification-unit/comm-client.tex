\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This component offers functionality to send alarms. Its task is
threefold. First of all, this component has to fetch the alarm recipients for
the module that is included in the Alarm. Furthermore the communication channel
through which the stakeholder is to be contacted (i.e. the emergency services and/or one
or more customers) has to be retrieved. Therefore it uses the
\interface{RMConfigurationAPI} interface of the database which contains all user
information. Third, once the channel is acquired it has to contact the
TransportMap to ask for the right Transport unit which can be used to send the
notification.

\subsection{Provided interfaces}
