\subsection{Roles and responsibilities}

\npar This component offers functionality to send alarms. It's task is
twofold. First of all this component has to fetch the communication channel
through which it has to contact the stakeholder (i.e. the emergency services
and/or one or more customers). Therefore it uses the \interface{CustomerProfile}
interface of the database which contains all user information. Secondly, once
the channel is acquired it has to contact the transport pool to ask for the
right transport unit which can be used to send the notification.
