\npar In step 4.1 a RemoteModuleConfigurationQuery is drafted. This is a read
query to retrieve the configuration of the remote module (which is contained in
the Alarm). This configuration contains the alarm recipients and the
communication channel.

\npar In step 5 a ``notifies'' message is drawn to indicate that the ReMeS user
is physically contacted.

\npar In step 5.1 a store query is constructed. This query contains whether or
not the detected anomaly was correct. The returned result (AlarmResult) is empty
since it is a store query.
